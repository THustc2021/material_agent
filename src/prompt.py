<Role>
    You are a scientist supervisor tasked with managing a conversation for scientific computing between the following workers: {members}. You don't have to use all the members, nor all the capabilities of the members.
<Objective>
    Given the following user request, decide which the member to act next, and do what
<Instructions>:
    1.  If the plan is empty, For the given objective, come up with a simple, high level plan based on the capability of the team listed here: {teamCapability} and the restrictions listed here: {teamRestriction} 
        You don't have to use all the members, nor all the capabilities of the members.
        This plan should involve individual tasks, that if executed correctly will yield the correct answer. Do not add any superfluous steps. 
        The result of the final step should be the final answer. Make sure that each step has all the information needed - do not skip steps.
        
        Runing ensemble calculation with BEEF-vdW functional and analyze the result can give you uncertainty information.
        To run ensemble calculation, with the same functional you need to first relax the structure, and then with the relaxed structure, use the BEEF-vdW functional and ensemble calculation to get the distribution of energies.
        
        !!! To calculate adsorption energy, you need to run calculations with the SAME functional for: relaxed adsorbate, relaxed clean slab, and relaxed slab with adsorbate !!!
        !!! If you are going to use BEEF-vdW functional later you need to use BEEF-vdW functional for all ealier calculations !!!
        In the plan, you need to be clear what pseudopotential to use when finding pseudopotentials, what functional to use when generating the input files.
        
        If the plan is not empty, update the plan:
        Your objective was this:
        {{input}}

        Your original plan was this:
        {{plan}}

        Your pass steps are:
        {{past_steps}}

        Update your plan accordingly, and fill out the plan. Only add steps to the plan that still NEED to be done. Do not return previously done steps as part of the plan. 
        choose plan if there are still steps to be done, or response if everything is done.
    2.  Given the conversation above, suggest who should act next. next could only be selected from: {OPTIONS}.
    3.  inspect the CANVAS, extract information needed, then base on what the agent just did, the info you extracted, and the plan, decide what to do next.
    4.  If your end result is different from your expectation, please reflect on what you have done by inspect and read through the canvas, scientificly, try to understand why the result is different, list out possible reasons, adjust your plan accordingly, and try to eliminate possible causes one by one.
        Do not stop until the end result is within user specified margin of error, or you have tried everything you can think of. Only if user did not specify a margin of error, you can judge by yourself.

Description
.. note::
   The behavior of the MEAM potential for alloy systems has changed
   as of November 2010; see description below of the mixture_ref_t
   parameter
Pair style *meam* computes non-bonded interactions for a variety of
materials using the modified embedded-atom method (MEAM) :ref:`(Baskes)
<Baskes>`.  Conceptually, it is an extension to the original :doc:`EAM
method <pair_eam>` which adds angular forces.  It is thus suitable for
modeling metals and alloys with fcc, bcc, hcp and diamond cubic
structures, as well as materials with covalent interactions like silicon
and carbon.
The *meam* pair style is a translation of the original Fortran version
to C++. It is functionally equivalent but more efficient and has
additional features. The Fortran version of the *meam* pair style has
been removed from LAMMPS after the 12 December 2018 release.
Pair style *meam/ms* uses the multi-state MEAM (MS-MEAM) method
according to :ref:`(Baskes2) <Baskes2>`, which is an extension to MEAM.
This pair style is mostly equivalent to *meam* and differs only
where noted in the documentation below.
In the MEAM formulation, the total energy E of a system of atoms is
given by:
.. math::
   E = \sum_i \left\{ F_i(\bar{\rho}_i)
       + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i \neq j} \phi_{ij} (r_{ij}) \right\}
where *F* is the embedding energy which is a function of the atomic
electron density :math:`\rho`, and :math:`\phi` is a pair potential
interaction.  The pair interaction is summed over all neighbors J of
atom I within the cutoff distance.  As with EAM, the multi-body nature
of the MEAM potential is a result of the embedding energy term.  Details
of the computation of the embedding and pair energies, as implemented in
LAMMPS, are given in :ref:`(Gullet) <Gullet>` and references therein.
The various parameters in the MEAM formulas are listed in two files
which are specified by the :doc:`pair_coeff <pair_coeff>` command.
These are ASCII text files in a format consistent with other MD codes
that implement MEAM potentials, such as the serial DYNAMO code and
Warp.  Several MEAM potential files with parameters for different
materials are included in the "potentials" directory of the LAMMPS
distribution with a ".meam" suffix.  All of these are parameterized in
terms of LAMMPS :doc:`metal units <units>`.
Note that unlike for other potentials, cutoffs for MEAM potentials are
not set in the pair_style or pair_coeff command; they are specified in
the MEAM potential files themselves.
Only a single pair_coeff command is used with the *meam* style which
specifies two MEAM files and the element(s) to extract information
for.  The MEAM elements are mapped to LAMMPS atom types by specifying
N additional arguments after the second filename in the pair_coeff
command, where N is the number of LAMMPS atom types:
* MEAM library file
* Element1, Element2, ...
* MEAM parameter file
* N element names = mapping of MEAM elements to atom types
See the :doc:`pair_coeff <pair_coeff>` page for alternate ways
to specify the path for the potential files.
As an example, the ``potentials/library.meam`` file has generic MEAM
settings for a variety of elements.  The ``potentials/SiC.meam`` file
has specific parameter settings for a Si and C alloy system.  If your
LAMMPS simulation has 4 atoms types and you want the first 3 to be Si,
and the fourth to be C, you would use the following pair_coeff command:
.. code-block:: LAMMPS
   pair_coeff * * library.meam Si C sic.meam Si Si Si C
The first 2 arguments must be \* \* so as to span all LAMMPS atom types.
The first filename is the element library file. The list of elements following
it extracts lines from the library file and assigns numeric indices to these
elements. The second filename is the alloy parameter file, which refers to
elements using the numeric indices assigned before.
The arguments after the parameter file map LAMMPS atom types to elements, i.e.
LAMMPS atom types 1,2,3 to the MEAM Si element.  The final C argument maps
LAMMPS atom type 4 to the MEAM C element.
If the second filename is specified as NULL, no parameter file is read,
which simply means the generic parameters in the library file are
used.  Use of the NULL specification for the parameter file is
discouraged for systems with more than a single element type
(e.g. alloys), since the parameter file is expected to set element
interaction terms that are not captured by the information in the
library file.
If a mapping value is specified as NULL, the mapping is not performed.
This can be used when a *meam* potential is used as part of the
*hybrid* pair style.  The NULL values are placeholders for atom types
that will be used with other potentials.
.. note::
   If the second filename is NULL, the element names between the two
   filenames can appear in any order, e.g. "Si C" or "C Si" in the
   example above.  However, if the second filename is **not** NULL (as in the
   example above), it contains settings that are indexed **by numbers**
   for the elements that precede it.  Thus you need to ensure that you list
   the elements between the filenames in an order consistent with how the
   values in the second filename are indexed.  See details below on the
   syntax for settings in the second file.
